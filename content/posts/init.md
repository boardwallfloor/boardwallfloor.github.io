# My Blog

Hello,

I don't know what this gonna be but for now this serve as sort of dev log and diaries of things that I do with my project.
I created it so that I could create sort of post mortem and documentation of things that I have done in the past and hopefully could comeback when I need to.
This could have been personal and private, and instead of blog I would've used [Obisidan.md](https://obsidian.md/) and I definitely could. Partly because I really like it. But putting it online sort of put accountability that are rather important because I would have just put it later.

Anyway that's all there is to it, maybe I would do post mortem and dev log for my previous project but for now I think i will stick to current and upcoming one.

Good day, and see ya!
